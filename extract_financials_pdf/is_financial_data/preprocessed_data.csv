SOCIAL PERFORMANCE,0
CONTINUEDSocial performance has three dimensions:,0

PATIENTS,0
Of the <NUM> million people living with,0
"diabetes worldwide, three out of four live in",0
low- and middle-income countries with,0
"weak healthcare systems, implying that",0
millions of people have inadequate access,0
to diabetes care.,0
<DATE> Nordisk’s strategy for global access to,0
diabetes care addresses this unmet need.,0
The company’s long-term target is to reach,0
<NUM> million people with its diabetes care,0
products by <DATE> – double the <DATE> base  -,0
line number.,0
<DATE> Nordisk provided medical treatments,0
to an estimated <NUM> million people with,0
"diabetes worldwide in <DATE>, compared with",0
<NUM> million in <DATE>. This <NUM>% increase was,0
driven by sales of human insulin (<NUM> million,0
people) and modern and new-generation,0
insulin (<NUM> million people).,0
Current projections show that it will not be,0
possible to reach this target. This is due to a,0
more challenging market environment than,0
anticipated in <DATE> when the long-term,0
target was set. <DATE> Nordisk remains,0
committed to continuing its efforts to reach,0

organisations with an effective guarantee,0
that <DATE> Nordisk will ensure availability of,0
low-priced human insulin at a lower ceiling,0
price than the previous pricing policy. In,0
"<DATE>, the price will be <NUM> US dollars per vial.",0
<DATE> Nordisk sold human insulin according,0
to the company’s differential pricing policy,0
in <NUM> of the <NUM> Least Developed Countries,0
"in <DATE>, compared with <NUM> countries in",0
<DATE>. The pricing policy is offered through,0
government tenders or private market,0

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE,0
<DATE> Nordisk measures environmental,0
performance across four dimensions: use of,0
"resources, emissions, organic residues and",0
waste. All of <DATE> Nordisk’s production,0
facilities are certified according to ISO,0
<DATE><NUM> The production of active pharma -,0
"ceutical ingredients in Kalundborg,",0
"Denmark, is also certified according to",0
ISO <DATE><NUM>,0
"In line with expectations, use of resources",0
"and waste increased, while organic residues",0
and CO <NUM> emissions from energy use at,0
production sites and product distribution,0
decreased.,0
RESOURCES,0
Despite a sharp focus on process optimi -,0
"sations, energy use increased by <NUM>% and",0
water use by <NUM>% due to increases in,0
"production, increased capacity and",0
expansions to meet market demands. Two,0
facilities are located in regions subject to,0
"high water stress, consuming <NUM>% of the",0
total water consumption used at <DATE>,0
Nordisk sites. There were no water short  -,0
"age incidents and, overall, water consump -",0
tion at these facilities decreased in <DATE>.,0
"EMISSIONS, ORGANIC",0
RESIDUES AND WASTE,0
<DATE> Nordisk’s climate action programme,0
aims to reduce CO<NUM> emissions throughout,0
the value chain. The current focus includes,0
"energy used in production, distribution of",0
"products, company cars and business",0
"flights. As of <DATE>, indirect emissions from",0
the supply chain are included in the climate,0
action programme. <DATE> Nordisk engages with strategic suppliers with the aim of,0
increasing energy efficiency and shifting to,0
renewable energy.,0
"While energy consumption increased, the",0
overall CO<NUM> emissions from energy con  sump -,0
tion decreased from <NUM> tons to <NUM>,0
tons. This is a result of ongoing conversion,0
to less CO<NUM> intensive energy sources as part,0
of the effort to grow the share of renewable,0
"energy. At the end of <DATE>, <NUM>% of all",0
power for production came from renewable,0
sources. All but one production site in,0
"Denmark use gas from biogas plants, and",0
the facility in Brazil makes steam from,0
certified wood. The remaining production,0
facilities use natural gas.,0
CO<NUM> emissions from product distribution,0
decreased by <NUM>% to <NUM> tons due to,0
continuous conversion from air transport to,0
distribution by sea.,0
"Organic residues, a by-product of the",0
production of active pharmaceutical,0
"ingredients (API), decreased slightly due to",0
changes in the product mix of API. The,0
energy in these residues is first recovered in,0
"biogas plants, and the digested slurry is",0
then used as fertiliser on local farmland.,0
Waste increased by <NUM>% compared with,0
"<DATE>, mainly due to increased pilot",0
production where regeneration of ethanol,0
is not possible. Reducing ethanol waste is a,0
"high priority for <DATE> Nordisk, and efficient",0
regeneration plants enable repeated reuse,0
of the ethanol.LONG-TERM,0
ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS,0
The long-term ambition is to decouple,0
consumption of water and energy from,0
sales growth. The current target is set as a,0
maximum of half of the percentage,0
"increase in sales in local currencies,",0
"measured as a three-year average. In <DATE>,",0
sales increased by <NUM>% in local currencies,0
while energy consumption increased by <NUM>%,0
and water consumption increased by <NUM>%.,0
The lower sales growth reflects the chal  -,0
"lenging business environment in <DATE>,",0
while the increased consumption of energy,0
and water is the result of new capacity,0
building to meet market demands. Under,0
"these circumstances, it is not feasible to",0
meet the current targets for the foresee -,0
able future. New targets are being,0
developed to replace them.,0
"In <DATE>, <DATE> Nordisk set a target for all",0
production sites to use electricity from,0
renewable sources by <DATE>. The company,0
"has signed up to the RE<NUM> initiative, a",0
"coalition of companies, committed to",0
<NUM>% renewable electricity led by The,0
"Climate Group in partnership with CDP, a",0

Supply of Components,0
"Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from",0
"single or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,",0
"tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times",0
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.,0
"The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize",0
"custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the",0
"suppliers’  yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued  availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,",0
may be affected if suppliers decide to concent rate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s,0
requirements.,0
"The Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or",0
"renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.",0
Research and Development,0
"Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technolog ical advances, the Company’ s ability to compete successfully",0
"depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company",0
"continues to develop new technologies to enhan ce existing products and services, and to expan d the range of its offerings through research and development",0
"(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology .",0
Intellectual Property,0
"The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and",0
"services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although",0
the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in,0
"part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.",0
"The Compa ny regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and",0
"marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and",0
registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’ s products and,0
services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.,0
"In addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third",0
"parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’ s products, processes and services. While the",0
"Company has generally  been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be",0
obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.,0

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions,0
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday,0
"demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product",0
introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product,0
"launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers",0
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.,0
Human Capital,0
"The Company believes it has a talented, motiva ted and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team",0
"members. As of <DATE> <NUM> <DATE>, the Company had approximately <NUM> full-time equivalent employees.",0

Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their,0
"professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and",0
resources that are designed to support employees’  individual growth and development.,0
Inclusion and Diversity,0
The Company is comm itted to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company,0
"continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture , and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all",0

Macroeconomic and Industry Risks,0
The Compa ny’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can,0
"materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
"The Compa ny has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales. In addition, the Company’ s",0
"global suppl y chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’ s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the",0

"Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemploymen t, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency",0
"fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adverse ly affect demand for the Company’ s products and services. In",0
"addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility ,",0
"declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.",0
"In addition to an adverse  impact on demand for the Company’ s products and services, uncertain ty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions",0
"can have a significant impact on the Company’ s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel",0
"partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency .",0
Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’ s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties,0
and other financial institu tions; limitations on the Company’ s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’ s financial,0
"instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.",0

"The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales, and the Company believes that it",0
generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners,0
"located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on",0
"imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’ s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’ s ability to",0
offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions,0
where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company,0
"to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing",0
"the Company’ s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the",0
Company’ s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse,0
"impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions",0
"being impos ed on the Company’ s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly",0
more severe  and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international,0
"disputes could also have a negative ef fect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely af fect the Company’ s business.",0
"Many of the Company’ s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the Company’ s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations",0
"that are prone to earth quakes and other natur al disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power",0
"shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,",0
"labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-<NUM> pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’ s control. Global climate",0
"change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes  and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense",0
"effects. Such  events can make it difficult or impo ssible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in",0
"the Compan y’s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’ s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer",0
"spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Compan y can require substantial recovery time, experience significant",0
"expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many",0
"critical components, a business interruption af fecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company .",0
The Compan y’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’ s suppliers are,0
"required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to",0
"the Compan y’s business, and harm to the Com pany’ s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-<NUM> pandemic, have",0
"adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer",0
"products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement",0
"of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’ s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the",0
"supply of current products and of fering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.",0
"While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insuf ficient to cover all losses that may arise.",0
"Global markets for the Company’ s products and services are highly competitive and subje ct to rapid technological change, and the Company may be",0
unable to compete ef fectively in these markets.,0
The Company’ s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward,0
"pressure on gross marg ins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in",0
"product price  and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and",0
businesses.,0
"The Company’ s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and",0
"technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,",0
"numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these",0

Apple Inc. | <DATE> Form <NUM>-K | <NUM>,0
"The Compa ny currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register , additional patents,",0
"trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’ s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,",0
and by imitating the Company’ s products and infringing on its intellectual property . Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every,0
country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if,0
"competitors infringe on the Company’ s intellectual property , the Company’ s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely af fected.",0
"The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in",0
"these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital",0
"content supplier relationships. In addition, some  of the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of",0
active device s. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have,0
"the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have",0
from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.,0
"Additionally , the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products or",0
collaborate to offer solutions that are more comp etitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate,0
the Company’ s approach to providing components seamlessly within their of ferings or work collaboratively to of fer integrated solutions.,0
"The Compa ny’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established",0
service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes,0
with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.,0
"The Company’ s business, results of operations  and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’ s ability to continually improve its products and",0
services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Com pany will be able to continue to provide products and services,0
that compete ef fectively .,0
Business Risks,0
"To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products",0
and services.,0
"Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature  of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new",0
"products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and",0
"services, and successfully manage the transitio n to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions",0
"depends on a number of factors, including timel y and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’ s ability to manage the risks associated with",0
"new technol ogies and production ramp-up issue s, the availability of application software for the Company’ s products, the effective management of purchase",0
"commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet",0
"anticipated demand, and the risk that new produ cts and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will",0
successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.,0
"The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical servic es provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are",0
located outside of the U.S.,0
"Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,",0
"South Korea , Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is curre ntly performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often",0
in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’ s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.,0
"The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce",0
the Company’ s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the,0
"quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Com pany’ s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although",0
"arrangements with these partners may contain  provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the",0
consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.,0
"While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can",0
"materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",0
Apple Inc. | <DATE> Form <NUM>-K | <NUM>,0
"The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing",0
"partners primarily locate d in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’ s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a",0
"negative impact on the Company’ s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final",0
"destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,",0
"armed conflict, economic, business, labor , environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.",0
"The Company has inves ted in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to",0
"certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if",0
"these outsou rcing partne rs or suppliers experien ce severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or",0
"terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.",0
Future operating results depend upon the Company’ s ability to obtain components in suf ficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.,0
"Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many",0
"components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing",0
"fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor",0
"industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the Company’ s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of",0
components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into,0
"agreements for the supp ly of many components,  there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or",0
"at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to busin ess failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular",0
"industry , further limiting the Company’ s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or",0
"regional economic conditions on the Company’ s suppliers, described in “The Compan y’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional",0
"economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition, ”",0
"above, can also affect the Company’ s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price",0
"increases that can materially adversely af fect its business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
"The Company’ s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source . When a component or product uses new technologies, initial",0
capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’  yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these,0
"components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including  if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common",0
components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s requirements. When the Company’ s supply of components for a new or existing product,0
"has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company , the Company’ s business,",0
results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’ s,0
"business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’ s business and finan cial performance could also be materially adversely affected",0
"depending on the time required to obtain suf ficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain suf ficient quantities from an alternative source.",0
The Company’ s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect,0
the Company’ s business and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation.,0
The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating,0
"system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company , often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of",0
hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products  the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects,0
could make the Compa ny’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . These risks may increase as the,0
"Company’ s products are introduced into speciali zed applications, including health. In addition, the Company’ s service offerings can have quality issues and from",0
"time to time experience outages, service slowdo wns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’ s services have not performed as anticipated and may",0
"not meet customer expe ctations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and",0
"services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’ s products and services. In addition, the",0
"Company can be expos ed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifica tions, write-of fs of inventory , property , plant and equipment or",0
"intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the",0
"experience for users of the Company’ s product s and services, and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market",0
"acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.",0
Apple Inc. | <DATE> Form <NUM>-K | <NUM>,0
"The Company is expos ed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and othe r assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation",0
risk.,0
"The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds",0
net realizabl e value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for order s of excess products and components. The Company reviews,0
"long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’  facilities and inventory prepayme nts, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate",0
"the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occur red, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the",0
"carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory , capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and",0
"purchase commitments are currently recoverab le, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges",0
given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.,0
The Compa ny orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase,0
"obligations cover the Company’ s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typica lly for periods up to <NUM> days. Because the Company’ s markets",0
"are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or",0
"insuf ficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.",0
"The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property , which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or",0
at all.,0
"The Company’ s products and services are desig ned to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In",0
"addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent",0
"coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’ s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property",0
"rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.",0
"Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially",0
"reasonable terms. Howe ver, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the",0
"right to use third-party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain",0
"products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
The Company’ s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.,0
The Compa ny believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and,0
services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’ s,0
"products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’ s products, customers may choose not to buy",0
the Company’ s products.,0
The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’  perception and,0
"analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’ s products compared to competitors’",0
"platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.",0
"This analysis  may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected",0
"future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.",0
"The Company’ s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade",0
software for the Company’ s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’  products with larger,0
"market share. When developers focus their ef forts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’ s devices can suf fer.",0
The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative  software applications for its products. The Company’ s products,0
"and operatin g systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party develo pers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of",0
"change, their applications can fail to take adva ntage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in",0

Financial Risks,0
The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.,0
"The Compa ny’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the",0
Company’ s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’ s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure,0
"due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressure s and product pricing actions that the Company may take in",0
response to such pressu res; increased competition; the Company’ s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed,0
"product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering",0
"content for the Company’ s services; the Compan y’s ability to manage product quality and warran ty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or",0

services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’ s results of operations and financial,0
condition.,0
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday,0
"demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further , the Company",0
generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The,0
"Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’ s products or services, issues with new",0
"product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’ s logistics, components supply ,",0
or manufacturing partners.,0
The Company’ s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.,0
"The Compan y’s primary exposure to movements  in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses",0
worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’ s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the,0
past been adversely af fected and could in the future be materially adversely af fected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.,0
The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated sales and,0

"competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar ’s strengthening, which would adversely affect",0
the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.,0
"Conversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies  relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated sales and",0
"earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreig n currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.",0
"Additionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’ s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely",0

movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.,0
The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.,0
"The Company’ s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deteriorat ion, financial results, market and economic conditions, political",0
"risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’ s cash, cash equivalents and marketable",0

"in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to dif fering interpretations.",0
The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and,0
governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its,0

General Risks,0
The price of the Company’ s stock is subject to volatility .,0
"The Company’ s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally , the Company , the technology",0
"industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in",0
ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’  operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases,0
its stock in a given perio d to exceed the stock’ s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future,0
"growth and profitability . The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow ,",0
"and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’ s Board of Directors, and",0
the Company’ s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to,0
"future growth, profitability , dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’ s stock may decline significantly , which could",0

FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST <NUM> <DATE>ANNUAL REPORT<DATE>,0
<DATE> <NUM> <DATE>,0
Dear Costco Shareholders:,0
"When we started fiscal <DATE>, we expected to proceed with business as usual, focusing on providing Costco members with quality",0
merchandise and exceptional value. Little did we know what lay ahead.,0
"As the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe and crippled much of the world’s economy, Costco was designated as an essential",0
"business, a responsibility we took seriously. In a time of uncertainty and panic purchasing by members, we went 'all out' to tryto maintain adequate supplies of necessities, including food, cleaning products, and personal care items. We targeted our effortson these in-demand goods, installed protective barriers at the registers, increased our sanitation at high-touch areas, establishedsocial distancing protocols and face covering policies, created special operating hours for high-risk individuals and first responders,and donated surgical masks to healthcare workers. Certain of our ancillary businesses were temporarily closed, and our foodcourts continue to face significant restrictions. In addition, Costco Travel endured a tumultuous time, as tens of thousands ofmembers canceled bookings and requested refunds. To reward our employees for exemplary service in difficult times, wetemporarily increased compensation levels and otherwise increased spending for wages and benefits, including overtime pay.",0
"Net sales for fiscal <DATE> totaled $<NUM> billion, an increase of <NUM>%, with a comparable sales increase of <NUM>%. Net income was $<NUM>",0
"billion, or $<NUM> per diluted share, an increase of <NUM>%. In addition, the Company surpassed <NUM> million members worldwide,contributing to membership revenue of $<NUM> billion.",0
"Costco.com played a vital role in meeting members’ needs, especially those choosing or required to stay at home. Our ecommerce",0
"business saw a <NUM>% increase in sales. Increases were particularly evident in same day and <NUM>-day grocery deliveries, prescriptionmedications, electronics, and office supplies.Additional strong sales were seen in apparel, appliances, health and beauty products,and home furnishings. Our depots responded to unprecedented volume by shifting certain operations to <NUM> hours a day, sevendays a week. As circumstances allowed, expansion in fiscal <DATE> continued, with the opening of <NUM> new warehouses. In fiscal<DATE>, we expect to open <NUM> new buildings.",0
"While international trade issues and tariffs threatened increased prices on some goods, we worked diligently on both short- and",0
"long-term mitigation strategies. Buyers worked with suppliers to share in the absorption of tariffs, create new efficiencies in logisticsand transportation, and move production origin. Buyers were committed to keeping us in stock, despite reduced workforces,factory closures, government restrictions and financial hardships.",0
"The Kirkland Signature™ brand saw another solid year, with global sales exceeding $<NUM> billion. This growth of <NUM>% was a result",0
"of several factors, including an emphasis on core items in categories such as grocery, health and beauty, home cleaning, andpaper goods. Continuous improvements were a focus for key items, such as diapers, bar soap and frozen foods. We introducednew products in expanded categories, including the first Kirkland Signature putter, motor oil, copper exposed cookware, andapparel items. Our chicken complex in Nebraska became fully operational in fiscal <DATE>.",0
"Costco also made two important investments this year, the acquisition of Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or",0
"CWL) and a minority interest in Navitus. CWL is a logistics supplier, with infrastructure for efficient delivery and installation of bigand bulky items, such as appliances, furniture, and exercise equipment. Navitus, a pharmacy benefit manager, will help us lowerthe health care spend for patients at our pharmacies, optical and hearing aid departments. Both acquisitions align with ourphilosophy of reducing costs and passing on the savings to our members.",0
We continue to address sustainability in our supply chains. We support good land stewardship practices that include: avoiding,0
"deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems; sourcing products from responsibly managed and certified forests; andfocusing on preserving native grasslands. Through these efforts and others, we seek to protect valuable natural resources andreduce our environmental impact. Our Sustainability Commitment was updated in <DATE> <DATE> to outline our progress thisyear and includes our new Climate Action Plan and Forest Conservation Commitment. In fiscal <DATE>, Costco donated an estimated<NUM> million pounds of food to those in need.",0
"As we near the end of this extraordinary year, I extend my deepest gratitude to Costco employees, especially those on the front",0
"lines of our warehouses, whose exemplary service to members, dedication to the company, and support of one another has trulydemonstrated excellence. Finally, I thank Costco members around the world for their loyal support and trust in our business.Together, we’ve made it through this trying year, and I am confident we will tackle whatever is ahead with strength and optimism.",0
"From the Costco family to yours, I wish you a happy, prosperous and healthy New Year.",0
"Sincerely,",0

PART I,0
"Item <NUM>—BusinessCostco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in <DATE>, in",0
"Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in theUnited States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia,Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated <NUM>, and <NUM> warehouses worldwide at <DATE> <NUM> <DATE>, <DATE> <NUM> <DATE>, and <DATE> <NUM> <DATE>,respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea,Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select <DATE>, under thesymbol “COST.”",0
"We report on a <DATE>-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday",0
"nearest the end of <DATE>. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarterconsists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a <NUM>-week year). The material seasonalimpact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season.References to <DATE>, <DATE>, and <DATE> relate to the <NUM>-week fiscal years ended <DATE> <NUM> <DATE>,<DATE> <NUM> <DATE>, and <DATE> <NUM> <DATE>, respectively.",0
General,0
We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a,0
"limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories willproduce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficienciesachieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills,self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably atsignificantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. Wegenerally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early paymentdiscounts.",0
We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation,0
"points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturersand quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handlingefficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.",0
<NUM>,0
"Our average warehouse space is approximately <NUM> square feet, with newer units being slightly",0
"larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling ofmerchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality ofmerchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances andexits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those oftypical retail operations.",0
"Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, <NUM>-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have",0
"extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to otherefficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales.Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing largequantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certaincredit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholderrebates, executive member <NUM>% reward certificates and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).",0
Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we,0
"believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes,and colors. We carry an average of approximately <NUM> active stock keeping units (SKUs) perwarehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We averageanywhere from <NUM> to <NUM> SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Manyconsumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.",0
"In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain",0
"electronic items, we typically have a <NUM>-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical supportservices, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certainelectronic items.",0
We offer merchandise in the following categories:,0
"• Food and Sundries (including dry foods, packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy,",0
"alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)",0
"• Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden",0
and patio),0
"• Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)",0
• Softlines (including apparel and small appliances),0
• Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses),0
"Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services,",0
"encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies,optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses with gasstations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea orChina. We operated <NUM> gas stations at the end of <DATE>. Net sales for our gasoline business representedapproximately <NUM>% of total net sales in <DATE>.",0
Our e-commerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products,0
"and services, many not found in our warehouses. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately<NUM>% of total net sales in <DATE>. This figure does not consider other services we offer online in certaincountries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services.",0
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do,0
"not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. The COVID-<NUM> pandemic createdunprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continueto impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, weseek alternative sources. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long asquality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.",0
<NUM>,0
Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note <NUM> to the,0
consolidated financial statements included in Item <NUM> of this Report.,0
MembershipOur members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are,0
"available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with abusiness license, retail sales license or comparable document. Business members may add additionalcardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Starmembers. Our annual fee for these memberships is $<NUM> in our U.S. and Canadian operations and variesin other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card.",0
Our member renewal rate was <NUM>% in the U.S. and Canada and <NUM>% on a worldwide basis at the end of,0
<DATE>. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate isa trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to thereporting date.,0
Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed,0
"within the <NUM> months prior to the reporting date. At the end of <DATE>, we standardized our membershipcount methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition tothe count of approximately <NUM> million total cardholders for <DATE>, of which <NUM> million were paid members.The change did not impact <DATE> or <DATE>.

Competition,0
"Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection,",0
"location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis withglobal, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internetretailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling asingle category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among oursignificant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with other warehouse clubs(primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas inthe U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple clubs.",0
"Intellectual PropertyWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes,",0
"trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to ourbusiness and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development andprotection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale",0
®trademarks and our private-,0
"label brand, Kirkland Signature®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at",0
"prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandiseofferings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration ofour private-label items.",0
"We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other",0
"agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availabilityand duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and maybe renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.",0

Item <NUM>A—Risk Factors,0
"The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and",0
"results of operations. We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operatingin the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currentlyconsider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction withManagement 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item <NUM> and",0
our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item <NUM> of this Report.,0
Business and Operating Risks,0
"We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations,",0
"which comprised <NUM>% and <NUM>% of net sales and operating income in <DATE>, respectively. Within the U.S.,we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised <NUM>% of U.S. net sales in <DATE>.Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared toour other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations couldmaterially adversely affect our business and financial results. <DATE> in financial performance of ourU.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among otherthings: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends inoperating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets forwarehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix towardlower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, includinghigher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide highquality and innovative new products.",0
"We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in",0
"existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverseimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",0
"Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses",0
"and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use andother regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as localcommunity actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoptionof local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to findsuitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehousesand depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms.In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent orrestrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us.Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or leaseand operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our futuregrowth and profitability.",0
We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may,0
"draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable salesperformance, member traffic, and profitability.",0
We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in,0
"attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale cluboperators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market.Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitorswith a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commercewebsites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materiallyadversely affected.",0
<NUM>,0
"We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy",0
and efficiency of our supply chains. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable thanopening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.,0
"Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect",0
our results of operations.,0
Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in,0
"our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal ratesmaterially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impactcomparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales andmembership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.",0
"We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality,",0
"competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining memberloyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent agrowing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of memberacceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.",0
"Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other",0
facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.,0
"We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily",0
"through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities tosupport our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believethat our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemicsor other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems mayresult in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adverselyaffect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce business depends heavily on third-party logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable toprovide services in a timely fashion.",0
"We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively",0
"affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and ourmarket share.",0
It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will,0
"desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics andconsumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) andspending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our productsand services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjustingour purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, orwe may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both ofwhich would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, grossmargin and operating income.",0
Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital for our business,0
"to operate efficiently. Failure to execute complex IT projects, and have these IT systems availableto our business will adversely impact our operations.",0
IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business on a daily basis. These systems are utilized to,0
"process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventoryand produce reports which are critical for making business decisions on a daily, weekly and periodicbasis. Failure or disruption of these IT systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buyproducts from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficientmanner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology andIT transformation projects. The failure of these projects could adversely impact our business plans and",0
<NUM>,0
"potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process,",0
"it is important that we build strong digital resiliency for our business-critical systems to prevent disruptionfrom events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses,internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires,earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers andbackup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may causeserious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost ofmoving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making significantinvestments in enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in execution of these projects coulddelay our ability to be resilient to disruptive events. Failure to deliver our IT transformation effortsefficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact ourfinancial condition and results of operations.",0
We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst,0
"evolving threat landscapes and in compliance with emerging privacy and data protectionregulations globally. Failure to meet the requirements could damage our reputation with members,suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject tolitigation.",0
"Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems,",0
"networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed bythird parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect, store and processsensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these ITsystems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to ourbusiness operations and strategy. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-<NUM>pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Security threats designed to gain unauthorizedaccess to our systems, networks and data, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurityattacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticatedcomputer crimes and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of oursystems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our ITsystems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers, could havevulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and complianceposture seeks to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and ourthird-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect oursystems, information or other property.",0
"The potential impacts of a future material cybersecurity attack includes reputational damage, litigation,",0
"government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential orotherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in ITsystems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect ourcompetitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and loss of member confidence. Further, theamount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to acybersecurity attack. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. andinternational laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation,California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, China cybersecuritylaw and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe,which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.",0
We are subject to payment-related risks.,0
"We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks,",0
"co-brand cardholder rebates, executive member <NUM>% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offernew payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliancerequirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and otherrelated acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to",0
