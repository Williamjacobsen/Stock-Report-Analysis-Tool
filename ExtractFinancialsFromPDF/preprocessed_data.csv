SOCIAL PERFORMANCE,0
CONTINUEDSocial performance has three dimensions:,0
improving access to medical treatment and,0
"quality of care for patients, offering a",0
healthy and engaging working environ -,0

"responsible business practices are in place,",0
with the aim of contributing to the,0
communities in which the company,0
operates.,0
PATIENTS,0
Of the <NUM> million people living with,0
"diabetes worldwide, three out of four live in",0
low- and middle-income countries with,0
"weak healthcare systems, implying that",0
millions of people have inadequate access,0
to diabetes care.,0
Novo Nordisk’s strategy for global access to,0
diabetes care addresses this unmet need.,0
The company’s long-term target is to reach,0
<NUM> million people with its diabetes care,0
products by <NUM> – double the <NUM> base  -,0
line number.,0
Novo Nordisk provided medical treatments,0
to an estimated <NUM> million people with,0
diabetes worldwide in <NUM> compared with,0
<NUM> million in <NUM> This <NUM>% increase was,0
driven by sales of human insulin (<NUM> million,0
people) and modern and new-generation,0
insulin (<NUM> million people).,0
Current projections show that it will not be,0
possible to reach this target. This is due to a,0
more challenging market environment than,0
anticipated in <NUM> when the long-term,0
target was set. Novo Nordisk remains,0
committed to continuing its efforts to reach,0
more patients and improve diabetes care. In,0
<NUM> the company announced a new Novo,0
Nordisk Access to Insulin Commitment with,0
a broader scope to replace the longstanding,0
differential pricing policy. It provides low-,0
income countries and humanitarian relief,0
organisations with an effective guarantee,0
that Novo Nordisk will ensure availability of,0
low-priced human insulin at a lower ceiling,0
price than the previous pricing policy. In,0
<NUM> the price will be <NUM> US dollars per vial.,0
Novo Nordisk sold human insulin according,0
to the company’s differential pricing policy,0
in <NUM> of the <NUM> Least Developed Countries,0
in <NUM> compared with <NUM> countries in,0
<NUM> The pricing policy is offered through,0
government tenders or private market,0
distributors to all Least Developed Countries,0
(LDCs) as defined by the UN. In <NUM> the,0
ceiling price for insulin treatment per patient,0
"per day was USD <NUM>, while the average",0
realised price for insulin sold under the,0
programme was USD <NUM>. The total,0
number of people treated with insulin sold at or below the pricing policy price in the,0
LDCs decreased from <NUM> in <NUM> to,0

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE,0
Novo Nordisk measures environmental,0
performance across four dimensions: use of,0
"resources, emissions, organic residues and",0
waste. All of Novo Nordisk’s production,0
facilities are certified according to ISO,0
<NUM> The production of active pharma -,0
"ceutical ingredients in Kalundborg,",0
"Denmark, is also certified according to",0
ISO <NUM>,0
"In line with expectations, use of resources",0
"and waste increased, while organic residues",0
and CO <NUM> emissions from energy use at,0
production sites and product distribution,0
decreased.,0
RESOURCES,0
Despite a sharp focus on process optimi -,0
"sations, energy use increased by <NUM>% and",0
water use by <NUM>% due to increases in,0
"production, increased capacity and",0
expansions to meet market demands. Two,0
facilities are located in regions subject to,0
"high water stress, consuming <NUM>% of the",0
total water consumption used at Novo,0
Nordisk sites. There were no water short  -,0
"age incidents and, overall, water consump -",0
tion at these facilities decreased in <NUM>,0
"EMISSIONS, ORGANIC",0
RESIDUES AND WASTE,0
Novo Nordisk’s climate action programme,0
aims to reduce CO<NUM> emissions throughout,0
the value chain. The current focus includes,0
"energy used in production, distribution of",0
"products, company cars and business",0
flights. As of <NUM> indirect emissions from,0
the supply chain are included in the climate,0
action programme. Novo Nordisk engages with strategic suppliers with the aim of,0
increasing energy efficiency and shifting to,0
renewable energy.,0
"While energy consumption increased, the",0
overall CO<NUM> emissions from energy con  sump -,0
tion decreased from <NUM> tons to <NUM>,0
tons. This is a result of ongoing conversion,0
to less CO<NUM> intensive energy sources as part,0
of the effort to grow the share of renewable,0
energy. At the end of <NUM> <NUM>% of all,0
power for production came from renewable,0
sources. All but one production site in,0
"Denmark use gas from biogas plants, and",0
the facility in Brazil makes steam from,0
certified wood. The remaining production,0
facilities use natural gas.,0
CO<NUM> emissions from product distribution,0
decreased by <NUM>% to <NUM> tons due to,0
continuous conversion from air transport to,0
distribution by sea.,0
"Organic residues, a by-product of the",0
production of active pharmaceutical,0
"ingredients (API), decreased slightly due to",0
changes in the product mix of API. The,0
energy in these residues is first recovered in,0
"biogas plants, and the digested slurry is",0
then used as fertiliser on local farmland.,0
Waste increased by <NUM>% compared with,0
<NUM> mainly due to increased pilot,0
production where regeneration of ethanol,0
is not possible. Reducing ethanol waste is a,0
"high priority for Novo Nordisk, and efficient",0
regeneration plants enable repeated reuse,0
of the ethanol.LONG-TERM,0
ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS,0
The long-term ambition is to decouple,0
consumption of water and energy from,0
sales growth. The current target is set as a,0
maximum of half of the percentage,0
"increase in sales in local currencies,",0
measured as a three-year average. In <NUM>,0
sales increased by <NUM>% in local currencies,0
while energy consumption increased by <NUM>%,0
and water consumption increased by <NUM>%.,0
The lower sales growth reflects the chal  -,0
lenging business environment in <NUM>,0
while the increased consumption of energy,0
and water is the result of new capacity,0
building to meet market demands. Under,0
"these circumstances, it is not feasible to",0
meet the current targets for the foresee -,0
able future. New targets are being,0
developed to replace them.,0
In <NUM> Novo Nordisk set a target for all,0
production sites to use electricity from,0
renewable sources by <NUM> The company,0
"has signed up to the RE<NUM> initiative, a",0
"coalition of companies, committed to",0
<NUM>% renewable electricity led by The,0
"Climate Group in partnership with CDP, a",0
not-for-profit that runs the global disclosure,0
system for environmental impacts.,0
Novo Nordisk plans to set targets for other,0
focus areas under the climate ambition,0
programme. The ambition is to align the,0
targets with the goals of the Paris Agree -,0
ment to keep the rise in global temperature,0
well below <NUM> degrees Celcius.,0

"The Company’ s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and",0
"technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,",0
"numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features",0
"(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability , design innovation, a strong third-party software and",0
"accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability , service and support, and corporate reputation.",0
"The Company is focused  on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, persona l computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.",0
"The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well",0
"as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines,",0
lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and,0
"lowered product margins . Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The",0
Company’ s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and,0
"applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products, or",0
collaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer.,0
Supply of Components,0
"Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from",0
"single or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,",0
"tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times",0
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.,0
"The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize",0
"custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the",0
"suppliers’  yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued  availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,",0

requirements.,0
"The Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or",0

Research and Development,0
"Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technolog ical advances, the Company’ s ability to compete successfully",0

Intellectual Property,0
"The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and",0

the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in,0
"part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.",0
"The Compa ny regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and",0
"marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and",0
registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’ s products and,0
services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.,0
"In addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third",0
"parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’ s products, processes and services. While the",0
"Company has generally  been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be",0
obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.,0

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions,0
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday,0
"demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product",0
introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product,0
"launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers",0
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.,0
Human Capital,0

Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their,0
"professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and",0
resources that are designed to support employees’  individual growth and development.,0
Inclusion and Diversity,0
The Company is comm itted to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company,0

Macroeconomic and Industry Risks,0
The Compa ny’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can,0
"materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
"The Compa ny has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales. In addition, the Company’ s",0

"addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility ,",0
"declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.",0
"In addition to an adverse  impact on demand for the Company’ s products and services, uncertain ty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions",0
"can have a significant impact on the Company’ s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel",0
"partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency .",0
Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’ s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties,0
and other financial institu tions; limitations on the Company’ s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’ s financial,0
"instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.",0

"The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales, and the Company believes that it",0
generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners,0
"located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on",0
"imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’ s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’ s ability to",0
offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions,0
where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company,0
"to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing",0
"the Company’ s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the",0
Company’ s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse,0
"impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions",0
"being impos ed on the Company’ s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly",0
more severe  and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international,0
"disputes could also have a negative ef fect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely af fect the Company’ s business.",0
"Many of the Company’ s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the Company’ s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations",0
"that are prone to earth quakes and other natur al disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power",0
"shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,",0
"labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-<NUM> pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’ s control. Global climate",0
"change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes  and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense",0
"effects. Such  events can make it difficult or impo ssible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in",0
"the Compan y’s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’ s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer",0
"spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Compan y can require substantial recovery time, experience significant",0
"expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many",0
"critical components, a business interruption af fecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company .",0
The Compan y’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’ s suppliers are,0
"required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to",0
"the Compan y’s business, and harm to the Com pany’ s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-<NUM> pandemic, have",0
"adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer",0
"products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement",0
"of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’ s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the",0
"supply of current products and of fering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.",0
"While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insuf ficient to cover all losses that may arise.",0
"Global markets for the Company’ s products and services are highly competitive and subje ct to rapid technological change, and the Company may be",0
unable to compete ef fectively in these markets.,0
The Company’ s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward,0
"pressure on gross marg ins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in",0
"product price  and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and",0
businesses.,0
"The Company’ s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and",0
"technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,",0
"numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these",0

Apple Inc. | <NUM> Form <NUM>-K | <NUM>,0
"The Compa ny currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register , additional patents,",0
"trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’ s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,",0
and by imitating the Company’ s products and infringing on its intellectual property . Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every,0
country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if,0
"competitors infringe on the Company’ s intellectual property , the Company’ s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely af fected.",0
"The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in",0
"these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital",0
"content supplier relationships. In addition, some  of the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of",0
active device s. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have,0
"the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have",0
from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.,0
"Additionally , the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products or",0
collaborate to offer solutions that are more comp etitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate,0
the Company’ s approach to providing components seamlessly within their of ferings or work collaboratively to of fer integrated solutions.,0
"The Compa ny’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established",0
service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes,0
with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.,0
"The Company’ s business, results of operations  and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’ s ability to continually improve its products and",0
services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Com pany will be able to continue to provide products and services,0
that compete ef fectively .,0
Business Risks,0
"To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products",0
and services.,0
"Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature  of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new",0
"products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and",0
"services, and successfully manage the transitio n to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions",0
"depends on a number of factors, including timel y and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’ s ability to manage the risks associated with",0
"new technol ogies and production ramp-up issue s, the availability of application software for the Company’ s products, the effective management of purchase",0
"commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet",0
"anticipated demand, and the risk that new produ cts and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will",0
successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.,0
"The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical servic es provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are",0
located outside of the U.S.,0
"Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,",0
"South Korea , Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is curre ntly performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often",0
in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’ s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.,0
"The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce",0
the Company’ s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the,0
"quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Com pany’ s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although",0
"arrangements with these partners may contain  provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the",0
consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.,0
"While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can",0
"materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",0
Apple Inc. | <NUM> Form <NUM>-K | <NUM>,0
"The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing",0
"partners primarily locate d in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’ s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a",0
"negative impact on the Company’ s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final",0
"destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,",0
"armed conflict, economic, business, labor , environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.",0
"The Company has inves ted in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to",0
"certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if",0
"these outsou rcing partne rs or suppliers experien ce severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or",0
"terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.",0
Future operating results depend upon the Company’ s ability to obtain components in suf ficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.,0
"Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many",0
"components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing",0
"fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor",0
"industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the Company’ s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of",0
components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into,0
"agreements for the supp ly of many components,  there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or",0
"at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to busin ess failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular",0
"industry , further limiting the Company’ s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or",0
"regional economic conditions on the Company’ s suppliers, described in “The Compan y’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional",0
"economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition, ”",0
"above, can also affect the Company’ s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price",0
"increases that can materially adversely af fect its business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
"The Company’ s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source . When a component or product uses new technologies, initial",0
capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’  yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these,0
"components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including  if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common",0
components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s requirements. When the Company’ s supply of components for a new or existing product,0
"has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company , the Company’ s business,",0
results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’ s,0
"business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’ s business and finan cial performance could also be materially adversely affected",0
"depending on the time required to obtain suf ficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain suf ficient quantities from an alternative source.",0
The Company’ s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect,0
the Company’ s business and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation.,0
The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating,0
"system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company , often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of",0
hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products  the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects,0
could make the Compa ny’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . These risks may increase as the,0
"Company’ s products are introduced into speciali zed applications, including health. In addition, the Company’ s service offerings can have quality issues and from",0
"time to time experience outages, service slowdo wns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’ s services have not performed as anticipated and may",0
"not meet customer expe ctations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and",0
"services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’ s products and services. In addition, the",0
"Company can be expos ed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifica tions, write-of fs of inventory , property , plant and equipment or",0
"intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the",0
"experience for users of the Company’ s product s and services, and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market",0
"acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.",0
Apple Inc. | <NUM> Form <NUM>-K | <NUM>,0
"The Company is expos ed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and othe r assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation",0
risk.,0
"The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds",0
net realizabl e value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for order s of excess products and components. The Company reviews,0
"long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’  facilities and inventory prepayme nts, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate",0
"the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occur red, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the",0
"carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory , capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and",0
"purchase commitments are currently recoverab le, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges",0
given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.,0
The Compa ny orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase,0
"obligations cover the Company’ s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typica lly for periods up to <NUM> days. Because the Company’ s markets",0
"are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or",0
"insuf ficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.",0
"The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property , which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or",0
at all.,0
"The Company’ s products and services are desig ned to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In",0
"addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent",0
"coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’ s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property",0
"rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.",0
"Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially",0
"reasonable terms. Howe ver, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the",0
"right to use third-party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain",0
"products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
The Company’ s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.,0
The Compa ny believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and,0
services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’ s,0
"products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’ s products, customers may choose not to buy",0
the Company’ s products.,0
The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’  perception and,0
"analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’ s products compared to competitors’",0
"platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.",0
"This analysis  may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected",0
"future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.",0
"The Company’ s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade",0
software for the Company’ s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’  products with larger,0
"market share. When developers focus their ef forts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’ s devices can suf fer.",0
The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative  software applications for its products. The Company’ s products,0
"and operatin g systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party develo pers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of",0
"change, their applications can fail to take adva ntage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in",0
dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’ s products.,0

Financial Risks,0
The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.,0
"The Compa ny’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the",0
Company’ s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’ s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure,0
"due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressure s and product pricing actions that the Company may take in",0
response to such pressu res; increased competition; the Company’ s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed,0
"product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering",0
"content for the Company’ s services; the Compan y’s ability to manage product quality and warran ty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or",0

services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’ s results of operations and financial,0
condition.,0
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday,0
"demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further , the Company",0
generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The,0
"Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’ s products or services, issues with new",0
"product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’ s logistics, components supply ,",0
or manufacturing partners.,0

"The Compan y’s primary exposure to movements  in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses",0
worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’ s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the,0
past been adversely af fected and could in the future be materially adversely af fected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.,0
The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated sales and,0

"Conversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies  relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated sales and",0

movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.,0
The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.,0
"The Company’ s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deteriorat ion, financial results, market and economic conditions, political",0
"risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’ s cash, cash equivalents and marketable",0

The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and,0
governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its,0
"provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’ s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate",0
"determination of the Company’ s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previousl y accrued, the Company’ s business, results of operations and",0

General Risks,0
The price of the Company’ s stock is subject to volatility .,0
"The Company’ s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally , the Company , the technology",0
"industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in",0
ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’  operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases,0
its stock in a given perio d to exceed the stock’ s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future,0
"growth and profitability . The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow ,",0
"and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’ s Board of Directors, and",0
the Company’ s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to,0
"future growth, profitability , dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’ s stock may decline significantly , which could",0
