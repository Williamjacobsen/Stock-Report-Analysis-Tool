"The Company’ s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and",0
"technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,",0
"numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features",0
"(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability , design innovation, a strong third-party software and",0
"accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability , service and support, and corporate reputation.",0
"The Company is focused  on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, persona l computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.",0
"The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well",0
"as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines,",0
"lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and",0
"lowered product margins . Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The",0
"Company’ s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and",0
"applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products, or",0
"collaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer.",0
"Supply of Components",0
"Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from",0
"single or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,",0
"tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times",0
"subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.",0
"The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize",0
"custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the",0
"suppliers’  yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued  availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,",0
"may be affected if suppliers decide to concent rate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s",0
"requirements.",0
"The Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or",0
"renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.",0
"Research and Development",0
"Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technolog ical advances, the Company’ s ability to compete successfully",0
"depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company",0
"continues to develop new technologies to enhan ce existing products and services, and to expan d the range of its offerings through research and development",0
"(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology .",0
"Intellectual Property",0
"The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and",0
"services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although",0
"the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in",0
"part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.",0
"The Compa ny regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and",0
"marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and",0
"registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’ s products and",0
"services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.",0
"In addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third",0
"parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’ s products, processes and services. While the",0
"Company has generally  been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be",0
"obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.",0
"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3",0
"Business Seasonality and Product Introductions",0
"The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday",0
"demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product",0
"introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product",0
"launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers",0
"and distributors anticipate a product introduction.",0
"Human Capital",0
"The Company believes it has a talented, motiva ted and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team",0
"members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.",0
"Workplace Practices and Policies",0
"The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.",0
"Compensation and Benefits",0
"The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’ s success. The",0
"Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their",0
"professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and",0
"resources that are designed to support employees’  individual growth and development.",0
"Inclusion and Diversity",0
"The Company is comm itted to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company",0
"continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture , and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all",0
"employees.",0

"The Company believes that open and honest  communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work",0

"concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity .",0
"Health and Safety",0
"The Compa ny is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop",0
"measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety , security and crisis management training, and by putting specific",0
"programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally , the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team",0

"The Compan y’s busines s, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known",0
"or unknown,  including those described below . When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’ s business, reputation, results of",0
"operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely af fected.",0
"Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’ s results of opera tions and financial condition, past financial performance should",0
"not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.",0

"consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.",0
"Macroeconomic and Industry Risks",0
"The Compa ny’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can",0
"materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
"The Compa ny has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales. In addition, the Company’ s",0
"global suppl y chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’ s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the",0
"U.S. As a result, the Company’ s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.",0
"Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemploymen t, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency",0
"fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adverse ly affect demand for the Company’ s products and services. In",0
"addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility ,",0
"declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.",0
"In addition to an adverse  impact on demand for the Company’ s products and services, uncertain ty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions",0
"can have a significant impact on the Company’ s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel",0
"partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency .",0
"Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’ s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties",0
"and other financial institu tions; limitations on the Company’ s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’ s financial",0
"instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.",0
"The Company’ s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other internation al disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health",0
"issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.",0
"Political events, trade and other international  disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business",0
"interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy , and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,",0
"suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.",0
"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5",0
"The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales, and the Company believes that it",0
"generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners",0
"located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on",0
"imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’ s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’ s ability to",0
"offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions",0
"where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company",0
"to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing",0
"the Company’ s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the",0
"Company’ s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse",0
"impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions",0
"being impos ed on the Company’ s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly",0
"more severe  and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international",0
"disputes could also have a negative ef fect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely af fect the Company’ s business.",0
"Many of the Company’ s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the Company’ s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations",0
"that are prone to earth quakes and other natur al disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power",0
"shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,",0
"labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’ s control. Global climate",0
"change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes  and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense",0
"effects. Such  events can make it difficult or impo ssible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in",0
"the Compan y’s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’ s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer",0
"spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Compan y can require substantial recovery time, experience significant",0
"expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many",0
"critical components, a business interruption af fecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company .",0
"The Compan y’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’ s suppliers are",0
"required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to",0
"the Compan y’s business, and harm to the Com pany’ s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have",0
"adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer",0
"products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement",0
"of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’ s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the",0

"Dear Costco Shareholders:",0
"When we started fiscal 2020, we expected to proceed with business as usual, focusing on providing Costco members with quality",0
"merchandise and exceptional value. Little did we know what lay ahead.",0
"As the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe and crippled much of the world’s economy, Costco was designated as an essential",0
"business, a responsibility we took seriously. In a time of uncertainty and panic purchasing by members, we went 'all out' to tryto maintain adequate supplies of necessities, including food, cleaning products, and personal care items. We targeted our effortson these in-demand goods, installed protective barriers at the registers, increased our sanitation at high-touch areas, establishedsocial distancing protocols and face covering policies, created special operating hours for high-risk individuals and first responders,and donated surgical masks to healthcare workers. Certain of our ancillary businesses were temporarily closed, and our foodcourts continue to face significant restrictions. In addition, Costco Travel endured a tumultuous time, as tens of thousands ofmembers canceled bookings and requested refunds. To reward our employees for exemplary service in difficult times, wetemporarily increased compensation levels and otherwise increased spending for wages and benefits, including overtime pay.",0
"Net sales for fiscal 2020 totaled $163 billion, an increase of 9%, with a comparable sales increase of 8%. Net income was $4",0
"billion, or $9.02 per diluted share, an increase of 9%. In addition, the Company surpassed 100 million members worldwide,contributing to membership revenue of $3.54 billion.",0
"Costco.com played a vital role in meeting members’ needs, especially those choosing or required to stay at home. Our ecommerce",0
"business saw a 50% increase in sales. Increases were particularly evident in same day and 2-day grocery deliveries, prescriptionmedications, electronics, and office supplies.Additional strong sales were seen in apparel, appliances, health and beauty products,and home furnishings. Our depots responded to unprecedented volume by shifting certain operations to 24 hours a day, sevendays a week. As circumstances allowed, expansion in fiscal 2020 continued, with the opening of 13 new warehouses. In fiscal2021, we expect to open 20 new buildings.",0
"While international trade issues and tariffs threatened increased prices on some goods, we worked diligently on both short- and",0
"long-term mitigation strategies. Buyers worked with suppliers to share in the absorption of tariffs, create new efficiencies in logisticsand transportation, and move production origin. Buyers were committed to keeping us in stock, despite reduced workforces,factory closures, government restrictions and financial hardships.",0
"The Kirkland Signature™ brand saw another solid year, with global sales exceeding $52 billion. This growth of 7% was a result",0
"of several factors, including an emphasis on core items in categories such as grocery, health and beauty, home cleaning, andpaper goods. Continuous improvements were a focus for key items, such as diapers, bar soap and frozen foods. We introducednew products in expanded categories, including the first Kirkland Signature putter, motor oil, copper exposed cookware, andapparel items. Our chicken complex in Nebraska became fully operational in fiscal 2020.",0
"Costco also made two important investments this year, the acquisition of Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or",0
"CWL) and a minority interest in Navitus. CWL is a logistics supplier, with infrastructure for efficient delivery and installation of bigand bulky items, such as appliances, furniture, and exercise equipment. Navitus, a pharmacy benefit manager, will help us lowerthe health care spend for patients at our pharmacies, optical and hearing aid departments. Both acquisitions align with ourphilosophy of reducing costs and passing on the savings to our members.",0
"We continue to address sustainability in our supply chains. We support good land stewardship practices that include: avoiding",0
"deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems; sourcing products from responsibly managed and certified forests; andfocusing on preserving native grasslands. Through these efforts and others, we seek to protect valuable natural resources andreduce our environmental impact. Our Sustainability Commitment was updated in December 2020 to outline our progress thisyear and includes our new Climate Action Plan and Forest Conservation Commitment. In fiscal 2020, Costco donated an estimated65 million pounds of food to those in need.",0
"As we near the end of this extraordinary year, I extend my deepest gratitude to Costco employees, especially those on the front",0
"lines of our warehouses, whose exemplary service to members, dedication to the company, and support of one another has trulydemonstrated excellence. Finally, I thank Costco members around the world for their loyal support and trust in our business.Together, we’ve made it through this trying year, and I am confident we will tackle whatever is ahead with strength and optimism.",0
"From the Costco family to yours, I wish you a happy, prosperous and healthy New Year.",0

"PART I",0
"Item 1—BusinessCostco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in",0
"Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in theUnited States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia,Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 795,782, and 762 warehouses worldwide at August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018,respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea,Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under thesymbol “COST.”",0
"We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday",0
"nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarterconsists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonalimpact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season.References to 2020, 2019, and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 30, 2020,September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively.",0
"General",0
"We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a",0
"limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories willproduce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficienciesachieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills,self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably atsignificantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. Wegenerally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early paymentdiscounts.",0
"We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation",0
"points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturersand quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handlingefficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.",0
"3",0
"Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly",0
"larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling ofmerchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality ofmerchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances andexits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those oftypical retail operations.",0
"Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have",0
"extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to otherefficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales.Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing largequantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certaincredit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholderrebates, executive member 2% reward certificates and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).",0
"Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we",0
"believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes,and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) perwarehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We averageanywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Manyconsumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.",0
"In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain",0
"electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical supportservices, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certainelectronic items.",0
"We offer merchandise in the following categories:",0
"• Food and Sundries (including dry foods, packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy,",0
"alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)",0
"• Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden",0
"and patio)",0
"• Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)",0
"• Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)",0
"• Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses)",0
"Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services,",0
"encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies,optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses with gasstations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea orChina. We operated 615 gas stations at the end of 2020. Net sales for our gasoline business representedapproximately 9% of total net sales in 2020.",0
"Our e-commerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products",0
"and services, many not found in our warehouses. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately6% of total net sales in 2020. This figure does not consider other services we offer online in certaincountries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services.",0
"We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do",0
"not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic createdunprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continueto impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, weseek alternative sources. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long asquality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.",0
"4",0
"Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the",0
"consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.",0
"MembershipOur members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are",0
"available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with abusiness license, retail sales license or comparable document. Business members may add additionalcardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Starmembers. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and variesin other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card.",0
"Our member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of",0
"2020. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate isa trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to thereporting date.",0
"Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed",0
"within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membershipcount methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition tothe count of approximately 2.0 million total cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members.The change did not impact 2019 or 2018. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations werenot affected. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):",0

"Competition",0
"Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection,",0
"location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis withglobal, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internetretailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling asingle category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among oursignificant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with other warehouse clubs(primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas inthe U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple clubs.",0
"Intellectual PropertyWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes,",0
"trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to ourbusiness and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development andprotection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale",0
"®trademarks and our private-",0
"label brand, Kirkland Signature®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at",0
"prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandiseofferings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration ofour private-label items.",0
"We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other",0
"agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availabilityand duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and maybe renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.",0

"Item 1A—Risk Factors",0
"The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and",0
"results of operations. We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operatingin the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currentlyconsider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction withManagement 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and",0
"our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report.",0
"Business and Operating Risks",0
"We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations,",0
"which comprised 87% and 83% of net sales and operating income in 2020, respectively. Within the U.S.,we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 29% of U.S. net sales in 2020.Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared toour other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations couldmaterially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of ourU.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among otherthings: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends inoperating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets forwarehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix towardlower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, includinghigher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide highquality and innovative new products.",0
"We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in",0
"existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverseimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",0
"Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses",0
"and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use andother regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as localcommunity actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoptionof local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to findsuitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehousesand depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms.In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent orrestrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us.Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or leaseand operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our futuregrowth and profitability.",0
"We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may",0
"draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable salesperformance, member traffic, and profitability.",0
"We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in",0
"attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale cluboperators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market.Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitorswith a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commercewebsites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materiallyadversely affected.",0
"8",0
"We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy",0
"and efficiency of our supply chains. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable thanopening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.",0
"Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect",0
"our results of operations.",0
"Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in",0
"our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal ratesmaterially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impactcomparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales andmembership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.",0
"We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality,",0
"competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining memberloyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent agrowing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of memberacceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.",0
"Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other",0
"facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.",0
"We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily",0
"through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities tosupport our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believethat our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemicsor other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems mayresult in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adverselyaffect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce business depends heavily on third-party logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable toprovide services in a timely fashion.",0
"We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively",0
"affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and ourmarket share.",0
"It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will",0
"desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics andconsumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) andspending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our productsand services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjustingour purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, orwe may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both ofwhich would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, grossmargin and operating income.",0
"Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital for our business",0
"to operate efficiently. Failure to execute complex IT projects, and have these IT systems availableto our business will adversely impact our operations.",0
"IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business on a daily basis. These systems are utilized to",0
"process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventoryand produce reports which are critical for making business decisions on a daily, weekly and periodicbasis. Failure or disruption of these IT systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buyproducts from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficientmanner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology andIT transformation projects. The failure of these projects could adversely impact our business plans and",0
"9",0
"potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process,",0
"it is important that we build strong digital resiliency for our business-critical systems to prevent disruptionfrom events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses,internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires,earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers andbackup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may causeserious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost ofmoving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making significantinvestments in enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in execution of these projects coulddelay our ability to be resilient to disruptive events. Failure to deliver our IT transformation effortsefficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact ourfinancial condition and results of operations.",0
"We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst",0
"evolving threat landscapes and in compliance with emerging privacy and data protectionregulations globally. Failure to meet the requirements could damage our reputation with members,suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject tolitigation.",0
"Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems,",0
"networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed bythird parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect, store and processsensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these ITsystems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to ourbusiness operations and strategy. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Security threats designed to gain unauthorizedaccess to our systems, networks and data, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurityattacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticatedcomputer crimes and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of oursystems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our ITsystems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers, could havevulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and complianceposture seeks to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and ourthird-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect oursystems, information or other property.",0
"The potential impacts of a future material cybersecurity attack includes reputational damage, litigation,",0
"government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential orotherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in ITsystems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect ourcompetitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and loss of member confidence. Further, theamount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to acybersecurity attack. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. andinternational laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation,California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, China cybersecuritylaw and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe,which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.",0
"We are subject to payment-related risks.",0
"We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks,",0
"co-brand cardholder rebates, executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offernew payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliancerequirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and otherrelated acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to",0
