"The Company’ s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and",0
"technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,",0
"numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features",0
"(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability , design innovation, a strong third-party software and",0
"accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability , service and support, and corporate reputation.",0
"The Company is focused  on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, persona l computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.",0
"The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well",0
"as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines,",0
"lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and",0
"lowered product margins . Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The",0
"Company’ s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and",0
"applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products, or",0
"collaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer.",0
"Supply of Components",0
"Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from",0
"single or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,",0
"tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times",0
"subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.",0
"The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize",0
"custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the",0
"suppliers’  yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued  availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,",0
"may be affected if suppliers decide to concent rate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s",0
"requirements.",0
"The Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or",0
"renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.",0
"Research and Development",0
"Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technolog ical advances, the Company’ s ability to compete successfully",0
"depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company",0
"continues to develop new technologies to enhan ce existing products and services, and to expan d the range of its offerings through research and development",0
"(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology .",0
"Intellectual Property",0
"The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and",0
"services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although",0
"the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in",0
"part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.",0
"The Compa ny regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and",0
"marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and",0
"registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’ s products and",0
"services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.",0
"In addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third",0
"parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’ s products, processes and services. While the",0
"Company has generally  been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be",0
"obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.",0
"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3",0
"Business Seasonality and Product Introductions",0
"The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday",0
"demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product",0
"introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product",0
"launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers",0
"and distributors anticipate a product introduction.",0
"Human Capital",0
"The Company believes it has a talented, motiva ted and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team",0
"members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.",0
"Workplace Practices and Policies",0
"The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.",0
"Compensation and Benefits",0
"The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’ s success. The",0
"Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their",0
"professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and",0
"resources that are designed to support employees’  individual growth and development.",0
"Inclusion and Diversity",0
"The Company is comm itted to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company",0
"continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture , and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all",0
"employees.",0

"The Company believes that open and honest  communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work",0

"concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity .",0
"Health and Safety",0
"The Compa ny is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop",0
"measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety , security and crisis management training, and by putting specific",0
"programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally , the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team",0

"The Compan y’s busines s, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known",0
"or unknown,  including those described below . When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’ s business, reputation, results of",0
"operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely af fected.",0
"Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’ s results of opera tions and financial condition, past financial performance should",0
"not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.",0

"consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.",0
"Macroeconomic and Industry Risks",0
"The Compa ny’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can",0
"materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations and financial condition.",0
"The Compa ny has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales. In addition, the Company’ s",0
"global suppl y chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’ s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the",0
"U.S. As a result, the Company’ s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.",0
"Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemploymen t, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency",0
"fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adverse ly affect demand for the Company’ s products and services. In",0
"addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility ,",0
"declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.",0
"In addition to an adverse  impact on demand for the Company’ s products and services, uncertain ty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions",0
"can have a significant impact on the Company’ s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel",0
"partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency .",0
"Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’ s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties",0
"and other financial institu tions; limitations on the Company’ s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’ s financial",0
"instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.",0
"The Company’ s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other internation al disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health",0
"issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.",0
"Political events, trade and other international  disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business",0
"interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy , and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,",0
"suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.",0
"Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5",0
"The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales, and the Company believes that it",0
"generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners",0
"located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on",0
"imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’ s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’ s ability to",0
"offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions",0
"where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company",0
"to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing",0
"the Company’ s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the",0
"Company’ s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse",0
"impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions",0
"being impos ed on the Company’ s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly",0
"more severe  and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international",0
"disputes could also have a negative ef fect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely af fect the Company’ s business.",0
"Many of the Company’ s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the Company’ s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations",0
"that are prone to earth quakes and other natur al disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power",0
"shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,",0
"labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’ s control. Global climate",0
"change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes  and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense",0
"effects. Such  events can make it difficult or impo ssible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in",0
"the Compan y’s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’ s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer",0
"spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Compan y can require substantial recovery time, experience significant",0
"expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many",0
"critical components, a business interruption af fecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company .",0
"The Compan y’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’ s suppliers are",0
"required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to",0
"the Compan y’s business, and harm to the Com pany’ s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have",0
"adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer",0
"products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement",0
"of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’ s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the",0
